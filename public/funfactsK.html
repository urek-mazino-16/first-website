        <p> *   Until 1911, Kolkata was the capital of India due to its trade importance during the British Rule in India. Later, Delhi was made the capital of India. </p>
        <p> *	 The Eden Gardens Cricket Stadium has the third most sitting capacity in the world with around 67,000 people.</p>
        <p> *   The ever classic Tram of Kolkata has been serving the city since 1902. Around 125 trams are running by covering 25 routes.</p>
        <p> *   It has trams, it has metros, it has taxis, but Kolkata still depends on its traditional hand-pulled rickshaws to commute, the only one in India.</p>
        <p> *	 Kolkata Book Fair is said to be the most attended book fair in the world. With around 2 million visitors, this Fair is well known for its non-trade book fair.</p>
        <p> *	 Kolkata is home to Indiaâ€™s first newspaper- the Bengal Gazette, which started publishing from the city in 1780.</p>
        <p> *	 Although Saree is worn throughout India, when it comes to the traditional Indian sarees, the Bengali sarees have a unique place, and Kolkata is considered the most affluent market of Bengali sarees.</p>
